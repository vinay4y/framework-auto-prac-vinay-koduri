# framework-auto-prac-vinay-koduri

This project can be executed from mvn command line using the following command:

*clean verify "-Dcucumber.options=--tags @dev" -Dbrowser=chrome -DrunLocation=local*

This will execute the scripts in chrome in the local/dev environment.

To create an account using scripts, just need to update to unique email in the "Registration.feature" file and in "dataFile.yml"
Instead of hardcoding data, I am reading it from dataFile.yml. So, that we can create and update data, without touching the scripts.

By just changing the variable from the command prompt, the scripts can be executed in various browsers both **locally and remotly(anywhere in saucelab,seetest,browserstack or in selenium grid etc**(template in place and code partially done)

**Reports will be saved under target/cucumber-reports/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html**

**please read maven comments to execute the scripts in parallel**
